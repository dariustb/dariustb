# Hey I'm @dariustb!
## 👋🏾 Hey you guys! 

My name is Darius Brown and I'm a software engineer from Dallas, Texas. I'm based in New York City, NY, and currently work in Engineering at Bloomberg LP. I'm a big fan of music, spoken word poetry, and backend development! Feel free to visit my site, [https://dariusbrown.dev/](https://dariusbrown.dev/), for a more detailed list of my works and projects.

## 📚 I'm Always Learning!

The best way to get ready is to stay ready. I'm always picking up new ideas, working outside of the box, and finding newer and better ways to create as I continue my career in technology. My coding skillset consists of:
- **General Purpose**: C, C++, Python
- **Front End**: HTML, CSS, Less, Javascript
- **Back End**: Python, Ruby, PHP
- **Database**: MySQL, MongoDB
- **Frameworks**: Django, Flask, Bottle, Jekyll, Gatsby, Hugo, CodeIgniter, Phalcon
- **Operating Systems**: Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10, Linux Ubuntu, Parrot OS & Kali Linux

This list is only bound to expand as I develop more and study new things about different languages!

As of lately, I've been interested in creating music with technology and have started a couple projects on this idea. More updates to come 😊
